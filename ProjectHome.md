[My Web Fonts](http://www.mywebfonts.org) is a Javascript API that displays any fonts (TrueType, OpenType, Postscript Fonts,...) on any websites, any OS and any browsers, without additional plugins like Flash.

This project contains :
  * A Javascript API installed to the website.
  * Datas are generated with the [MyWebFonts Web Site](http://www.mywebfonts.org). This remote website is optional and all operations could be done locally.

This rendering is made with Prototype JS, AJAX, web standards (no Flash), and a little magic.

Accessibility is of course also guaranted.
